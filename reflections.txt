# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
	Roughly 4 hours.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	Completing this project without any conflicts.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	a) Feature One: Added support for formatting ascii table using terminal-table gem
		Why? Formatting looks good for eyes. Kinda an UX tweak.
  	b) Feature Two: Added support to change the due date of a todo item
  		Why? Most of us change our todo dates according to the current situation. So this feature makes sense

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
	I don't know exactly. There are many things actually. But the major one is not confusing ruby syntaxes with python syntaxes which I know already.
